This year, I focused on delivering high-quality, stable software solutions.

Successfully handled the complexity of the PandaAccountService, which involved managing 18 complex queries and efficiently processing data through multiple nested and multi-domain structures.

Supported continuous testing whenever required, promptly solving issues.
Supported continuous testing whenever required, promptly solving issues.

Implemented Kafka messaging logic and notification logic to produce Panda notifications to a file, effectively managing the two major components of the codebase.

Adapted to changing situations by adding necessary test cases when there was a need to deploy the Kafka part urgently, despite the changing codebase.

Built complex logic that was generic, performance-optimized, order-aware, and externalized based on query structure, ensuring loose coupling of components.

Proactively responded to evolving requirements by promptly making modifications while maintaining code stability.

Provided continuous support and delivered improvements, ensuring readiness for production and stability in UAT, while managing challenges like recursive JSON processing, GraphQL integration, and efficient sublist handling.

Moving forward, aim to further optimize processes for better scalability, reduce response times, enhance code quality, and maintainability, and continue to be a reliable resource for production deployments.

The code is ready for production and has proven to be stable in UAT.

This year, my focus was on delivering high-quality and stable software solutions.

Managed the complexity of PandaAccountService, which involved handling 18 complex queries and processing data across multiple nested and multi-domain structures.

Supported continuous testing and promptly resolved issues as they arose.

Implemented both Kafka messaging logic and notification logic, effectively managing these two major components of the codebase.

Adapted to changing requirements by adding necessary test cases when we needed to urgently deploy the Kafka part, despite the evolving codebase.

Built generic, performance-optimized logic that could handle ordering and was externalized based on query structure, ensuring loose coupling of components.

Responded quickly to evolving requirements, making necessary changes while keeping the code stable.

Provided ongoing support and improvements, ensuring readiness for production and stability in UAT while managing challenges like recursive JSON processing, GraphQL integration, and efficient sublist handling.

Looking ahead, my goal is to optimize processes for scalability, reduce response times, improve code quality, maintainability, and continue being a reliable resource for production deployments.

The code is now ready for production and has proven to be stable in UAT.

This year, my focus was on delivering high-quality and stable software solutions.

I worked on FDS changes, Fusion Production Support, GOS database changes, and AWS Elastic KT from a former team member.
