Thank you for sharing and refactoring the code base I built for the feature. I’m glad the implementation is performing well.
Just to note, points 4 and 5—validation of Radix responses and building flat data—were part of the initial implementation. However, point 5 still has some elements that need further work.

If there’s any further input or analysis required, please feel free to include me as well.

If there's any further input or analysis needed, feel free to loop me in.
If there's anything else to review or discuss, feel free to reach out
