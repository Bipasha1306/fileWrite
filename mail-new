Thank you for sharing and refactoring the code base I built for the feature. I’m glad the implementation is performing well.
Just to note, points 4 and 5—validation of Radix responses and building flat data—were part of the initial implementation. It’s great to know they were utilized effectively.

If there’s any further input or analysis required, please feel free to include me as well.
