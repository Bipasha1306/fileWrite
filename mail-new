Hi Ismail,

Thank you for sharing the detailed breakdown of the refactored code I built for the feature ,glad to see the implementation performing well. 
Just to note, points 4 and 5—validation of Radix responses and building flat data—were part of the initial implementation. It’s great to see them carried forward.

If there’s any further input or analysis required, please feel free add me as well.

Best regards,
