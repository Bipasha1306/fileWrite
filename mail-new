Thank you for sharing and refactoring the code base I built for the feature. I’m glad the implementation is performing well.
Just to note, points 4 and 5—validation of Radix responses and building flat data—were part of the initial implementation. However, point 5 still has some elements that need further work.

If there’s any further input or analysis required, please feel free to include me as well.
