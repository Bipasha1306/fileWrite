Subject: Re: Refactoring | EDPI to Radix

Hi Ismail,

Thank you for the detailed breakdown of the refactoring process. It’s great to see how everything has come together smoothly. While I was unavailable during the UAT phase due to personal commitments, I’m glad to see the foundational work I contributed to earlier has been fine-tuned for this release.

If there’s any further analysis or adjustments needed, I’d be happy to assist. Appreciate the efforts in ensuring this was finalized effectively!

Best regards,

Hi Ismail,

Thank you for the detailed breakdown of the refactoring process. I'm glad to see how well everything has come together. As you mentioned, during the UAT phase, I was unavailable due to personal commitments leading up to my marriage. However, I’m happy to see that the foundational work I contributed to earlier has been fine-tuned and optimized so effectively.

If there’s any further analysis or fine-tuning needed, feel free to reach out, and I’d be happy to assist where I can. Thanks again for carrying this forward so well!

Best regards,
