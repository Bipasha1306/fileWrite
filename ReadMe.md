Both of these code blocks are responsible for handling the case where an account is marked for deletion but not found in the JSON response. Let's break down each block:



1. **Inside the loop iterating over the JSON response:**
    ```java
    if (!found) {
        // Apply Hard Delete and write eventType
        String[] hardDeleteValues = new String[keys.size() + 1];
        Arrays.fill(hardDeleteValues, "\"\"");
        hardDeleteValues[0] = "\"" + accountId + "\"";
        hardDeleteValues[hardDeleteValues.length - 1] = "\"Hard Delete\"";
        stringWriter.write(String.join("\t", hardDeleteValues));
        stringWriter.write("\n");
        continue; // Skip writing other data for this account
    }
    ```
   This block is executed when an account marked for deletion is not found in the JSON response during the iteration over the accounts in the JSON response. It constructs a row with empty values for each column except the first one, which contains the account ID, and the last one, which contains "Hard Delete". This row is then written to the output.

2. **Outside the loop iterating over the JSON response:**
    ```java
    // Handle accounts marked for deletion but not found in the JSON response
    for (String accountId : eventTypeMap.keySet()) {
        if (!jsonResponse.contains(accountId)) {
            if (eventTypeMap.get(accountId).equals("Delete")) {
                String[] hardDeleteValues = new String[keys.size() + 1];
                Arrays.fill(hardDeleteValues, "\"\"");
                hardDeleteValues[0] = "\"" + accountId + "\"";
                hardDeleteValues[hardDeleteValues.length - 1] = "\"Hard Delete\"";
                stringWriter.write(String.join("\t", hardDeleteValues));
                stringWriter.write("\n");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
   This block is executed after the iteration over the JSON response. It checks each account ID in the eventTypeMap to see if it is present in the JSON response. If not, and if the eventType for that account is "Delete", it constructs a row similar to the previous block and writes it to the output.

In summary, both blocks serve the same purpose of handling accounts marked for deletion but not found in the JSON response. The first block handles this case within the loop over the JSON response, while the second block handles it separately after the loop.
